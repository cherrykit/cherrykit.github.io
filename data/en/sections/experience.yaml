- company:
    name: Bloomberg
    url: "https://www.bloomberg.com/"
    location: New York
    # company overview
    overview: I worked on the Ticker Plant Capacity and Performance team, which ensures that data from exchanges is processed reliably and efficiently.
  positions:
  - designation: Software Engineering Intern
    start: August 2022
    # don't provide end date if you are currently working there. It will be replaced by "Present"
    end: December 2022
    # give some points about what was your responsibilities at the company.
    responsibilities: 
    - Investigated algorithms and methods for the detection of performance regressions in a system processing realtime financial data, ensuring the availability of a system used by major financial corporations
    - Chose an anomaly detection algorithm suitable for the type of metric data available by evaluating the precision and recall of methods on sample data from the system
    - Designed and implemented an application which uses the proposed algorithm to detect performance regressions, resolving issues before they impact clients

- company:
    name: Waabi
    url: "https://waabi.ai/"
    location: Toronto
    overview: Waabi is developing software for autonomous trucking. My research was advised by Raquel Urtasun and Sergio Casas.
  positions:
  - designation: Research Intern
    start: May 2022
    end: August 2022
    responsibilities:
    - Developed and optimized trajectory prediction models to give the best predictions for vehicles that are important to the planning module of Waabiâ€™s self-driving software, improving prediction metrics for these vehicles by 10%
    - Presented a paper at an internal conference, reviewed other submissions for the conference and participated in discussions about presented topics

- company:
    name: Cryptography, Security, and Privacy Lab, University of Waterloo
    url: "https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/"
    location: Waterloo
    overview: I worked independently on a research project under Florian Kerschbaum and Ehsan Amjadian.
  positions:
  - designation: Undergraduate Research Fellow
    start: September 2021
    end: April 2022
    responsibilities:
    - Created a novel distributed anomaly detection system for PDF documents by clustering encrypted confidential data, allowing multiple parties to share early warnings about potential malware
    - Designed a custom PyTorch autoencoder to convert extracted features to a format suitable for inner product encryption, allowing distance computation between encrypted feature vectors without exposing other information
    - Made architecture resilient against adversarial attacks by training autoencoder to be robust against small changes in PDFs, decreasing the number of misclassifications caused by such modifications by 50%
    - Designed custom clustering algorithm to identify classes of similar PDFs based on distances between feature vectors, correctly grouping 94% of similar PDFs together and identifying 89% of existing classes

  - designation: Undergraduate Research Assistanceship
    start: May 2021
    end: August 2021
    responsibilities:
    - Created and implemented a new algorithm that reduces inequality comparisons over homomorphically encrypted data to a linear number of equality comparisons
    - Significantly increased number of calculations possible over homomorphically encrypted data by reducing the amount of consecutive multiplications to a desired level while increasing the number of overall multiplications
    - See [here](/posts/ura) for details

- company:
    name: Side Effects Software
    url: "https://www.sidefx.com/"
    location: Toronto
    overview: Side Effects create Houdini, a software used for creating 3D effects in video games and movies.
  positions:
  - designation: 3D Software Developer
    start: January 2021
    end: April 2021
    responsibilities:
    - Created prototypes for a new editing tool in the Houdini 3D modeling and special effects software using C++, allowing users to reduce the stretching or contraction of texture maps
    - Computed optimal shapes of triangles in mesh and used Least Squares Conformal Mapping algorithm with these shapes to obtain a modified texture map whose stretching and contraction is automatically reduced
    - Allowed redistribution of stretching and contraction of texture maps through user-defined weights by using a harmonic map
    - See [here](/posts/sideFX) for details
