- company:
    name: Bloomberg
    url: "https://www.bloomberg.com/"
    location: New York
    # company overview
    overview: I worked on the Ticker Plant Capacity and Performance team, which ensures that data from exchanges is processed reliably and efficiently.
  positions:
  - designation: Software Engineering Intern
    start: August 2022
    # don't provide end date if you are currently working there. It will be replaced by "Present"
    end: December 2022
    # give some points about what was your responsibilities at the company.
    responsibilities: 
    - Investigated algorithms and methods for the detection of performance regressions in Ticker Plant system, allowing detection of issues before they impact clients
    - Identified suitable anomaly detection algorithms by evaluating their detection rate and accuracy on sample data from the system, ensuring that engineers can confidently halt code promotion upon detection of an issue
    - Designed and implemented an application which uses the proposed algorithm to detect performance regressions, allowing resolution of issues without interruptions of service

- company:
    name: Waabi
    url: "https://waabi.ai/"
    location: Toronto
    overview: Waabi is developing software for autonomous trucking. My research was advised by Raquel Urtasun and Sergio Casas.
  positions:
  - designation: Research Intern
    start: May 2022
    end: August 2022
    responsibilities:
    - Redesigned trajectory prediction models in PyTorch to accurately simulate the behaviour of vehicles most important to the self-driving vehicle, improving prediction metrics for these vehicles by 10%
    - Simulated behaviour of other vehicles for each potential future trajectory of the self-driving vehicle, allowing the self-driving vehicle to drive more proactively by accounting for realistic reactions of other vehicles
    - Presented a paper at an internal conference, reviewed other submissions for the conference and participated in discussions about presented topics

- company:
    name: Cryptography, Security, and Privacy Lab, University of Waterloo
    url: "https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/"
    location: Waterloo
    overview: I worked independently on a research project under Florian Kerschbaum and Ehsan Amjadian.
  positions:
  - designation: Undergraduate Research Fellow
    start: September 2021
    end: April 2022
    responsibilities:
    - Created a novel distributed anomaly detection system for PDF documents by clustering encrypted confidential data, allowing multiple parties to share early warnings about potential malware
    - Designed a custom PyTorch autoencoder which preserves the similarity of 94% of feature vectors while enabling encryption of feature vectors, allowing comparison of confidential files
    - Improved resiliency against adversarial attacks by training autoencoder to be robust against small changes in PDFs, decreasing the number of misclassifications caused by such modifications by 50%
    - Designed custom clustering algorithm to identify classes of similar PDFs based on distances between encrypted feature vectors, correctly identifying 89% of existing classes

  - designation: Undergraduate Research Assistanceship
    start: May 2021
    end: August 2021
    responsibilities:
    - Implemented a new algorithm for inequality comparions over homomorphically encryped data that reduces the number of consecutive multiplications necessary, significantly increasing the total number of computations possible
    - See [here](/posts/ura) for details

- company:
    name: Side Effects Software
    url: "https://www.sidefx.com/"
    location: Toronto
    overview: Side Effects create Houdini, a software used for creating 3D effects in video games and movies.
  positions:
  - designation: 3D Software Developer
    start: January 2021
    end: April 2021
    responsibilities:
    - Created prototypes for a new editing tool in the Houdini 3D modeling and special effects software using C++, allowing artists to create better textures for 3D objects easier by reducing the stretching of texture maps
    - Computed optimal shapes of triangles in mesh to obtain a texture mapping whose stretching and contraction is automatically reduced, allowing simple adjustments without requiring user input
    - Allowed redistribution of stretching and contraction of texture maps through user-defined weights, ensuring that important portions of texture maps are not distorted on the 3D object
