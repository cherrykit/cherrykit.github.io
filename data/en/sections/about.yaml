# a summary about you
summary: >
  Hi! My name is Sophia and I'm passionate about doing research in multi-task
  reinforcement learning and meta reinforcement learning. I graduated with a
  Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo in April 2023
  and am currently looking for research and software development opportunities!
   

  I have research experience in both industry and academia, having dedicated eight
  months to full-time research and an additional eight months to part-time research
  alongside a full-time course load. In the past, I have worked on designing new machine
  learning architectures and have developed my academic writing skills through the 
  documentation of my research.


  I have extensive experience with C++ and Python programming, through my completion of
  six internships as well as courses involving software development projects. I have experience
  implementing and integrating new features in a large code base through my work at Bloomberg,
  Microsoft and IBM. I am experienced with a variety of algorithms and datastructures and I have
  previously worked with databases, operating systems, compilers and graphics.
   
   
  Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, doing art, playing video games and taking walks outside!
