In a group of four people. we designed and implemented a web application allowing users to look up information on Pokemon and generate team suggestions based on a set of owned Pokemon. We gathered data from open-source datasets on Pokemon and scraped data from the [Pokemon showdown](https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/) website to help us generate good team suggestions.

We wrote a comprehensive report detailing our database design and including images of our UI design, which is available [here](cs348.pdf). All our code can be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Diogenes2001/cs348-project).
