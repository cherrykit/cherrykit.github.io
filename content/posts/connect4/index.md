The Temporal Difference Learning agents were written in Java in a group of three people for the “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” course at the University of Waterloo (CS486). The code is built on top of an existing Java implementation of the Connect 4 game, including an optimal agent.

The code for our project can be found [here](https://github.com/cherrykit/Connect-Four). We wrote a course paper on the project, which can be found [here](connect4.pdf).
