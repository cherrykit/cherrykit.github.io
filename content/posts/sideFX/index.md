I spent my 4 month internship at Side Effects Software working on a tool to reduce the distortion of mapping textures onto 3D objects. This tool was designed based on user demand as well as market research into similar tools in other programs. During my internship, I built two prototypes, one using a Least Squares Conformal Mapping and one using Harmonic Maps.

At the end of my internship, I qualitatively compared the approaches in a report, which can be found [here](sidefx.pdf).
